Multiple tools to get Steam library info en masse. Originally for the devletter
scraper, but I realized that it's not actually dependent on anything. Plus, I
need to keep up this github activity somehow, since I just stopped totally
misusing it to update the original devletter site and actually figured out how
to shot web with the 'modern' iteration.

Setup:
Add your Steam API key to the 'secrets.py' file and/or STEAM_API_KEY 
environment variable. I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but eh.
